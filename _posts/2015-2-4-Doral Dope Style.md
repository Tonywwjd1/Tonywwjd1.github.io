>Introducing the New Dance Crew!

Welcome to Hip Hop Dance Miami! Have you ever seen those crazy dance movies like step up or you got served? 
All those dancers started somewhere. They either danced since they were just a young boy/girl or later go into the groove. 
Regardless the case may be, anyone can learn how to dance. It doesn’t matter how out of beat you are or can’t keep a rhythm.
As the founder of Hip Hop Dance Miami, I Anthony Santacruz, didn’t start dancing till I was at least 15 years old. All the
years before I didn’t even know what dancing was or what a simple 2-step was. I seriously can tell you I was in a really
bad position to become a professional anytime soon. So this all brings me back to the point where everyone has to have 
started somewhere. The one who really got me into the groove was one of my great friends Danny Ascuntar who was a starting 
“bboy” or breakdance boy. He taught me the basic steps of the breakdancing world. Even though I learned the steps I couldn’t 
go in rhythm with music. Yea it seems like my lessons weren’t bearing any fruit. But over time as you practice and practice 
your moves will look CLEANER and more in beat. Remember the old saying “practice makes perfect”, cause it’s the main reason 
why it separates the best dancers from the mediocre ones. So this is where I ask you one question. If you have always wanted
to learn how to bust a move at the club, or at a party to impress your friends, this is where you can learn just that! With 
our instructors who have performed in live shows in front of thousands of people; they have provided tutorial videos that go
step by step! Whether its iconic dance moves like the worm, the dougie, even the moonwalk can be learned here! The teams of
