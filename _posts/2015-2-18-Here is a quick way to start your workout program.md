# DUDEE.. HOW ARE YOU SO CONSISTENT IN THE GYM?
Well ladies and gentlemen it really isn't that hard. 
# DON'T BE SO LAZY
But other than that is just sitting down and writing a workout plan for you and start it.
For example: my workout plan is simple.
* Mondays: Leg/Abs Day
* Tuesdays: Chest Day
* Wednesdays: Tricep Day
* Thursdays: Back Day
* Fridays: Bicep Day
* Saturdays: Shoulders/Traps Day
* Sundays: Rest

Ofcourse this is just a sample. But you need at least one rest day and MAX two. If you really want to see results be consistent.
You can rearrange the days for each muscle group however you want. As a personal recommendation i do one muscle group per day, some like to do two in one day that can be anyones opinion which is better. I personally think by doing one muscle group a day you can maximize the growth of that muscle group by really concentrating on it that whole time that day in the gym.
