# Rising Sea Levels threatens South Florida

> Ahhh Miami Beach Florida, or should i say Welcome to the new Venice!

There are few places in the nation more vulnerable to rising sea levels than low-lying South Florida, a tourist and retirement mecca built on drained swampland.

The Obama administration is trying all they can to combat global warming.

Several actions are being held to try to solve the problem:

- Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend $100 million this year
- Miami Beach is expected to spend $400 million on an elaborate pumping system to cope with routine flooding.

“This is not a future problem. It’s a current problem,” said Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University and a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century.

“It’s getting to the point where some properties being bought today will probably not be able to be sold at the end of a 30-year mortgage,” said Harold Wanless, chairman of the geological sciences department at University of Miami.
