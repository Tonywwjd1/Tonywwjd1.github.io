# Ahhhh Leg Dayyyyy....
It is really important, when many others completely disregard working out legs.
# But WHY is it important?
Okay so, where your legs are there happens to be the most testosterone in your body. But what does this all mean?
Well, if you really activate your testosteron by working out legs this will increase your work effort on the other 
muscle groups throughout the week and increase size! It actually also increases your bench press and gives you better abs!
Why? because when your legs are stronger, you use your legs when you are benchpressing so it increases work done to lift the
amount of weight you put. Doing legs also give you better abs? This is because when you do squats your abs are working as well 
as your legs.
