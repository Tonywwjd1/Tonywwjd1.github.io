# Doral Dope Style and All The Way Productions came together to form the Into the Music Show

Just a [Sneek Peek](https://flic.kr/p/q7dAHQ) of all the madness.

##Into the Music
was a production that had to do with how music had evolved. From mozzart to all the Electronic Dance Music that is 
played all over the world. The production was a Theatrical Installment because there was actually a form
of acting as well as music and dance.

> Doral Dope Style REALLY went INTO THE MUSIC

why do i say that^^ because its true, we engaged into old dance practices and learned many forms of dance that havent been practiced before. Since our main focus is hip hop/breakdancing this was really new to us. Easy to learn, but not so easy to get into the groove because each style has its very own movement. In all we learned so much as dancers and could help us in the near future in our dancing careers.
