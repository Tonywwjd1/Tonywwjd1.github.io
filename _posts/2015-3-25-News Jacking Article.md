# You may have heard some of the recent updates for Web Design...

For example the Parallax effect mutations. Where designers use page 
scrolling or mouse movement to animate elemnts or properties of the page.


## Sounds pretty impressive right? 

According to 99designs.com there are actually other trending methods for the year 2015.

One that actually caught my attention was the rising of "flat" design.
It is actually said to be hailed the "king" of all designs. The icons 
look way better and traditional than the glossy web 2.0 icons.

## But on another note, designs are getting CIRCULAR!

Thats right, most designers think we are limited to just rectangular screened
designs. This could be true since all the monitors are rectangular. But since
we designers don't like to be constrained, there are new page layouts to "WOW"
your clients!

- Bubble designs
- 3D layouts
- Interactive backgrounds
Which all really grab ones attention, check out the link below for these new
trends and learn more!
