Literally just LOSE more than you GAIN. Many people out there are puzzled doing diets that are acutally making them
just stay where they are in their weight, or even GAIN weight. Cutting back on "bad-fats" and also strategically cutting on carbs as well. But also what people think is that youcan lose weight faster if your diet is really strict. This isnt entirely true, you will lose weight but you wont as fast as if you were doing exercise moderately! Though, what exercise should you be doing? High Intensity Cardio and some with weights.As you lose pounds and body fat % increase your intensity to maximize the results.
