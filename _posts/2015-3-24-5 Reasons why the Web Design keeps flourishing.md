In my university, (The Art Institute of Miami) we have the majors: Fashion, Graphic/Web Design, Advertising, Audio, Interior design, etc. The crazy part is how Web Design has the smallest group of students applied to that major. 

The Web Design industry is flourishing like crazy, since many of the students in my school are barely web designers, that really could be the case of other schools. 

#What does this mean?

Web Designers are needed. How can you have a business without a website? How can you make your store known without a website?

## So here are the 5 Reasons why the Web Industry is flourishing.

1. Web Designers are "rare":
When people think Web Design they think of coding automatically so they are frightened immediately. But in reality that isn't necessarily true. Theres many programs that have made Web Designing easier than people think is so hard. So those selected group of people that actually enjoy Web Design will have an advantage in their own career because since they are so rare they are in much need for small businesses that form or big companies that need help with their page.

2. Infinite Jobs:
there's so many jobs whether its for a company or you as a Web Designer become and take part in free lance so you aren't tied down to just one employer.

3. The Web is always coming up with new uses: there always new ways to use the internet. As a matter of a fact almost 80% of shoppers buy online now instead of leaving their home and going to a store to go see the product they are looking for, picking it out, and taking it to the cashier to pay for it. 


4. Everything revolves around the web.
The web is everything. People all over the world use the internet to buy, communicate, connect, search etc. That is why Web Design will only continue to flourish. There will always be new websites to view and explore that may have different things to offer and teach others.

5. No limit to Web Designers. There is not limit to Web Designers whether its front-end, back-end of Web Designing, or even CSS. There's so many different methods of performing the same task but can make clients "WOW" at what you could possible think of to display for them. Imagination runs wild with how you can design a site.
