# Steps to get noticed on the WEB! 

- Why Social Media? This is the first thing you should know. Social media is what everyone is using now a days to get noticed. A blog would help but social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are one of the biggest that grab the most attention.

- Is it really worth it? To consider getting into this world of social media is a huge step. Most just deny it and don't even try but once you get started you will automatically see how it will help you out with your main goal. 

- Getting Started... So what you should start to do is get accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram for example. There are others but those are the ones i am going to be talking about today. 

- What your profiles have to look like. Sell yourself. Make the bio short and sweet but explain what is so interesting about your page. 

- Posts have to be consistent. Make sure you are posting almost everyday to keep your followers entertained and wanting to comep back to your page.

- Create "grabber" titles. Making these titles will grab the users attention and will get them curious to know what the rest of the post is about.

- Content is as interesting as title. As well as the title being so interesting make the content of the post just as interesting. A "grabber" title can really cause a huge first time impression of a user coming across your post but it won't do any good if the body of your post isn't as interesting.

- Don't be a "one post wonder". I know many people who have social media accounts and make one amazing post that gets many views, likes, shares, etc. Once time passees by they stop after that one success. Or what happens is that the next posts aren't as good as the one that caught the most attention. So i repeat, don't be a one post wonder, keep your audience entertained make every post unique.

- Connect with your website and other social media pages. If you have a website, drive traffic to it! Lay down your website url on the bio of your accounts as well. If you have many followers or friends on these social media pages, and you add your website you could drive alot more traffic to yourself than ever before. 

- Nothing left to do except sell yourself! Just dish out everything you got. Keep the cycle going achieving followers, likes, etc. Make yourself or your business the best there is. Always aim high and have high expectations. Remember you can make it if you really want it.
