# Rising Sea Level threatens South Florida

> Ahhhhh Miami Beach, FL or should i say, welcome to the new Venice!

Sea-levels are drastically rising, but the obama administration is trying to prevent global warming. 
Tom Steyer, a billionaire environmental activist, has pledged to spend $100 million this year to help out as well.
In Miami Beach, which floods even on sunny days, the concern is palpable.
“This is not a future problem. It’s a current problem,” said Leonard Berry, director of the Florida Center for Environmental Studies at Florida Atlantic University and a contributing author of the National Climate Assessment, which found that sea levels have risen about 8 inches in the past century.
